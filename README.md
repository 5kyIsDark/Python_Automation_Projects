# ðŸ¤– Python Automation Projects

This repository is a collection of Python-based automation tools designed to simplify repetitive and everyday tasks.

Each tool is self-contained, beginner-friendly, and focused on solving a specific problem â€” such as organizing files, renaming batches of documents, merging PDFs, or handling screenshots. The scripts are stored in separate folders, each with its own dedicated `README.md` for setup and usage instructions.

These projects serve both as functional utilities and as practice for learning and improving real-world Python skills.

## ðŸ’» Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Standard libraries such as `os`, `shutil`, and `glob`
- Some tools may use third-party libraries like `PyPDF2` (noted in their folders)

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Clone the repository and explore each project folder:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/5kyIsDark/python_Automation_projects.git
cd python_Automation_projects
